1. Core Concepts (The Strong Foundation)
These are essentials every C++ programmer must know:

Variables, Types, and Operators

Control Flow: if, switch, loops (for, while)

Functions: declarations, definitions, parameters, return types

Arrays and Vectors: memory layout, indexing

Pointers and References: pointer arithmetic, dereferencing, referencing

🏗️ 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
C++ is a powerhouse for OOP—this is key to mastering real-world codebases:

Classes and Objects

Constructors / Destructors

Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism

Operator Overloading

Abstract Classes and Virtual Functions

💡 3. Memory Management
This separates the dabblers from the devs:

Dynamic Memory: new, delete

The Stack vs The Heap

Smart Pointers: std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr

RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)

⚙️ 4. The Standard Template Library (STL)
STL is your C++ superpower:

Containers: vector, map, set, unordered_map, etc.

Iterators and Range-based loops

Algorithms: sort, find, accumulate, transform

Lambda Expressions

🧵 5. Intermediate to Advanced Topics
When you’re ready to level up:

Templates: generic programming, type deduction

Exception Handling: try, catch, throw

Namespaces and static/extern

Const Correctness

Move Semantics and Rvalue References

🚀 6. Modern C++ (C++11 and beyond)
This is where “good” becomes “great”:

Range-based for loops

auto, decltype

constexpr, noexcept

Structured Bindings

std::optional, std::variant, std::tuple

🧪 Optional but Valuable Extras
Depending on your interests:

Multithreading & Concurrency

File I/O and Serialization

Design Patterns

Unit Testing with tools like GoogleTest
